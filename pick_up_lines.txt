Well, here I am. What are your other two wishes?
Hey, my name's Microsoft. Can I crash at your place tonight?
Are you French? Because Eiffel for you.
Do you like raisins? How do you feel about a date?
There is something wrong with my cell phone. It doesn't have your number in it.
If I could rearrange the alphabet, I’d put ‘U’ and ‘I’ together.
Aside from being sexy, what do you do for a living?
I must be a snowflake, because I've fallen for you.
Are you from Tennessee? Because you're the only 10 I see!
If you were a Transformer… you’d be Optimus Fine.
Are you a parking ticket? Because you’ve got FINE written all over you.
I wish I were cross-eyed so I can see you twice.
I must be in a museum, because you truly are a work of art.
Do you believe in love at first sight—or should I walk by again?
