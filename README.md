# my_message_generator

For this project, I will build a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output.  The project may be in a couple of different forms, like an astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. To make your program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data. I'll utilize my knowledege of JavaScript syntax to build the program and customize it to my liking.

Project Objectives:

Build a message generator program using JavaScript
Use Git version control
Use command line
Develop locally on my computer
