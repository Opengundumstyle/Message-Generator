# Message-Generator

According to the instruction, I've decided to apply the message generator for 'DATING APPS' to enhance the user experience.

After an "accidental" successful match, users are "obligated" to chat with each other;
Sometimes it's hard to break the ice sometimes for both side of the chat;
Here's when Message-Generator comes in and save the day;
We'll provide user with an icebreaking sentence from our database collection next to the UI;
IN CASE you dont like it we have more...
